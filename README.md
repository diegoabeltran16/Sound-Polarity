# Sound-Polarity - A tool for music composition

## Description
This project aims to develop a Python-based application that generates musical scales and chords based on user input and integrates the I Ching trigrams for enhanced emotional and harmonic depth. By leveraging advanced musical theory and the principles of the I Ching, the application will provide a comprehensive tool for exploring and creating complex musical compositions. The approach will involve iterative prototyping to validate concepts and ensure a robust, user-friendly, and scalable solution

### Scope
The project encompasses the design and implementation of a comprehensive musical theory application that allows users to input musical parameters and receive detailed outputs of scales, modes, and chords. The application will include features such as automated analysis of user-submitted terms, database management, and user-friendly interface design. Additionally, the application will integrate the I Ching trigrams to provide a unique perspective on harmonic and emotional mappings in music.

### Specific Objectives

- **Enable Quick and Intuitive Access to Musical Terms and Structures for Users**
Provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly search for and access musical scales and chords.
Implementation: Develop a search functionality within the application where users can type in a term, and the application will return relevant musical terms and structures from the database.

- **Provide Specialty-Specific Term Lists**
Offer curated lists of musical scales and chords specific to different categories (e.g., major scales, minor chords).
Implementation: Organize the database of musical terms into categories based on types (scales, chords, etc.). Create a user interface where users can select a category to view the relevant terms.

- **Allow for Easy Expansion and Updates to the Database**
Ensure the database of musical terms can be easily expanded and updated without significant rework or downtime.
Implementation: Set up a relational database with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Provide an admin interface or API endpoints to facilitate updates and maintain data integrity and consistency.

- **Automatically Analyze and Organize New Information Provided by Users**
Implement functionality to accept, analyze, and organize new musical terms submitted by users.
Implementation: Use natural language processing (NLP) and rule-based systems to parse and understand new terms provided by users. Automatically categorize and tag new terms and update the database accordingly.

- **Ensure the Bot is User-Friendly and Accessible**
Design the application to be intuitive and accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
Implementation: Follow UX design principles to create an intuitive interface. Conduct user testing to gather feedback and make improvements. Ensure compliance with accessibility standards by incorporating features like screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and appropriate color contrasts.

- **Incorporate Best Programming Practices for Maintainability and Scalability**
Build the application using clean, modular code that is easy to maintain and scale as the user base grows.
Implementation: Use a modular architecture to separate concerns and improve maintainability. Follow coding standards and best practices. Implement automated testing to ensure code quality. Use version control for source code management. Plan for scalability by designing the system to handle increased load, possibly using cloud infrastructure and load balancing.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
