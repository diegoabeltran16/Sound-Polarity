# Sound-Polarity 
A tool for music composition

## Description
This project aims to develop a Python-based application that generates musical scales and chords based on user input and integrates the I Ching trigrams for enhanced emotional and harmonic depth. By leveraging advanced musical theory and the principles of the I Ching, the application will provide a comprehensive tool for exploring and creating complex musical compositions. The approach will involve iterative prototyping to validate concepts and ensure a robust, user-friendly, and scalable solution

### Scope
The project encompasses the design and implementation of a comprehensive musical theory application that allows users to input musical parameters and receive detailed outputs of scales, modes, and chords. The application will include features such as automated analysis of user-submitted terms, database management, and user-friendly interface design. Additionally, the application will integrate the I Ching trigrams to provide a unique perspective on harmonic and emotional mappings in music.

### Math and Algorithms

-**Scale Generation Algorithm**
- **Input:** Tonic note and scale type (major or minor).
- **Process:**
- [ ] Define the pattern for major and minor scales.
- [ ] Use the pattern to generate the scale starting from the tonic note.
- **Output:** List of notes in the scale.

**Example**
```
{
def generate_scale(tonic, scale_type):
    major_pattern = [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
    minor_pattern = [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2]
    pattern = major_pattern if scale_type == 'major' else minor_pattern
    
    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']
    start_index = notes.index(tonic)
    
    scale = [tonic]
    current_index = start_index
    for interval in pattern:
        current_index = (current_index + interval) % len(notes)
        scale.append(notes[current_index])
    
    return scale

}
```

-**Chord Generation Algorithm**
- **Input:** Scale and chord type (e.g., major, minor, diminished, augmented).
- **Process:**
- [ ] Define intervals for each chord type.
- [ ] Generate chords by selecting notes from the scale based on intervals.
- **Output:** List of notes in the chord.

**Exmple**
```
def generate_chord(scale, chord_type):
    intervals = {
        'major': [0, 4, 7],
        'minor': [0, 3, 7],
        'diminished': [0, 3, 6],
        'augmented': [0, 4, 8]
    }
    chord_intervals = intervals[chord_type]
    
    chord = [scale[i] for i in chord_intervals]
    return chord

```

-**I Ching Mapping Algorithm**
- **Input:** Generated chords and modes.
- **Process:**
- [ ] Map each chord and mode to a binary representation based on the I Ching.
- [ ] Use the binary representation to find the corresponding trigram or hexagram.
- **Output:** Mapped I Ching trigrams and hexagrams.

**Example**
```
def map_to_i_ching(chord):
    binary_representation = ''.join(['1' if note in chord else '0' for note in 'CDEFGAB'])
    trigrams = {
        '000': 'â˜· (Earth)',
        '001': 'â˜³ (Thunder)',
        '010': 'â˜µ (Water)',
        '011': 'â˜´ (Wind)',
        '100': 'â˜¶ (Mountain)',
        '101': 'â˜² (Fire)',
        '110': 'â˜± (Lake)',
        '111': 'â˜° (Heaven)'
    }
    return trigrams.get(binary_representation[:3], 'Unknown')

# Example Usage
chord = ['C', 'E', 'G']
trigram = map_to_i_ching(chord)
print(trigram)  # Output: â˜° (Heaven)

```

### Best Practices for Math and Calculations in the Sound-Polarity Project

-**Use Libraries for Mathematical Operations**
- **Practice:** Utilize established libraries for mathematical operations to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
- [ ] NumPy: Use NumPy for efficient array and matrix operations.
- [ ] SciPy: Use SciPy for more advanced mathematical computations.

**Example**
```
import numpy as np

# Example: Using NumPy for scale generation
def generate_scale(tonic, pattern):
    notes = np.array(['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B'])
    start_index = np.where(notes == tonic)[0][0]
    
    scale_indices = (start_index + np.cumsum([0] + pattern)) % len(notes)
    scale = notes[scale_indices]
    
    return scale.tolist()

# Major scale pattern
major_pattern = [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
generate_scale('C', major_pattern)

```

-**Optimize Algorithms for Efficiency**
- **Practice:** Ensure algorithms are optimized for time and space complexity, especially when dealing with large datasets or real-time calculations.
- [ ] Avoid Redundant Calculations: Cache results of expensive operations if they will be used multiple times.
- [ ] Vectorization: Use vectorized operations instead of loops where possible.

**Example**
```
import numpy as np

# Using NumPy for efficient vectorized operations
def generate_chords(scale):
    chord_intervals = np.array([
        [0, 4, 7],  # Major triad
        [0, 3, 7],  # Minor triad
        [0, 3, 6],  # Diminished triad
        [0, 4, 8]   # Augmented triad
    ])
    
    scale_indices = np.arange(len(scale))
    chords = [scale[(scale_indices + interval) % len(scale)] for interval in chord_intervals]
    
    return chords

scale = np.array(['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B'])
generate_chords(scale)

```

-**Ensure Numerical Stability**
- **Practice:** Pay attention to numerical stability to avoid issues such as floating-point precision errors.
- [ ] Use Integer Arithmetic: Where possible, use integer arithmetic to avoid precision issues.
- [ ] Precision Control: Use libraries that handle precision and rounding appropriately.

**Example**
```
{
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext

# Setting precision for decimal calculations
getcontext().prec = 10

def precise_addition(a, b):
    return Decimal(a) + Decimal(b)

result = precise_addition(0.1, 0.2)
print(result)  # Output: 0.3000000000

```

-**Modularize Mathematical Functions**
- **Practice:** Break down complex mathematical operations into smaller, reusable functions.
- [ ] Single Responsibility: Each function should perform a single task.
- [ ] Reusability: Ensure functions are generic enough to be reused in different parts of the project.

**Example**
```
def add_intervals(note, intervals):
    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'A#', 'B']
    start_index = notes.index(note)
    return [notes[(start_index + interval) % len(notes)] for interval in intervals]

def generate_major_triad(note):
    return add_intervals(note, [0, 4, 7])

def generate_minor_triad(note):
    return add_intervals(note, [0, 3, 7])

generate_major_triad('C')  # Output: ['C', 'E', 'G']
generate_minor_triad('A')  # Output: ['A', 'C', 'E']

```

-**Testing and Validation of Mathematical Functions**
- **Practice:** Write unit tests for all mathematical functions to ensure they produce correct results.
- [ ] Test Edge Cases: Include tests for edge cases and unusual inputs.
- [ ] Automated Testing: Use a testing framework to automate the running of tests.

**Example**
```
import unittest

class TestMusicTheory(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_generate_scale(self):
        self.assertEqual(generate_scale('C', [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1]), ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B'])

    def test_generate_major_triad(self):
        self.assertEqual(generate_major_triad('C'), ['C', 'E', 'G'])

    def test_generate_minor_triad(self):
        self.assertEqual(generate_minor_triad('A'), ['A', 'C', 'E'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
